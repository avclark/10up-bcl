# Better Custom Login
Better Custom Login is a simple WordPress plugin that creates a custom login screen for 10up.

## Assumptions
- This is a custom plugin specifically for 10up and not intended for general distribution.
- No custom fields or customization ability in the WP admin. 

## Qualifications
Normally, a plugin created for general distribution would utilize OOP best practices, etc. However, for the purposes of this exercise, the plugin combines multiple elements and functions into as few files as possible within the plugin directory.

## Installation
- We probably don't need to cover how to install WordPress plugins. ;)

## Walkthrough
I made a short video walking through the plugin and explaining the thought process behind some of the decisions I made. The video is included in the repo, but here is a link to view if online if you prefer: https://cl.ly/2f1M0d2c0i3I.
